# Testing in React with Vitest and React Testing Library

## Overview

I created a simple app that fetches a list of 20 users from a local Restful API
and added a dropdown functionality to display additional details. I also wrote
tests for the frontEnd and Backend.

## Features

- **Vitest Integration**
- **React Testing Library**
- **Node.js**

### Viewing Test Coverage

To generate and view test coverage reports I used npm:

```
npm run test -- --coverage
```
